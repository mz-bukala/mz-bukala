ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Marta!

I have been working as a manual tester for almost 5 years. I have experience in testing e-commerce platforms (e.g. Magento), media services / broadcast media production services, museum systems and content management systems (e.g. Wordpress).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing performance testing and test automation skills.
